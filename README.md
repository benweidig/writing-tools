# Collection of tools and resources for writing an O'Reilly book

This is more like a personal collection to gather all (publicly available) resources at a single place.
But they might be helpful for others, so I decided to make a public repo for them.

# Atlas

* [Atlas Documentation](https://docs.atlas.oreilly.com)
* [VSCode Snippets](snippets/README.md)
* [Atlas Scripts](scripts/README.md)

# O'Reilly Guides
